Make sure you have the necessary modules installed. You will need the "os" and "random" modules.
Replace the string assigned to the "traits_path" variable with the path to your own "traits" folder.
Run the code. It will read the contents of the text files in the "traits" folder, select random values from them, and write the resulting set of traits to a new text file called "character_traits.txt".
Open the "character_traits.txt" file to view the generated set of character traits.
